# 🔥 Tantalus' Tantalizations - Infernal Smoothie Ordering 🔥

*A cursed smoothie ordering application forged in the depths of Snowflake's Streamlit workshop*

## What Dark Magic Is This?

This unholy creation is part of Snowflake's **Badge 3: Data Application Builders Workshop** - a learning exercise to master the dark arts of Streamlit applications within Snowflake's realm.

## The Ritual

Mortals may approach the altar and:
- **Label themselves** as the condemned customer
- **Select up to 5 fruits** from Tartarus' frozen fields  
- **Submit their order** as a blood sacrifice to the database

The application channels data from the `smoothies.public.fruit_options` table and inscribes orders into the `smoothies.public.orders` tome for all eternity.

## Summoning Instructions

Deploy this accursed app within your Snowflake environment's Streamlit realm. The spirits will handle the rest.

*"Fresh from the frozen-over fields of Tartarus! You won't need to bend or reach to get these frozen treats!"* 🍓👹

> **Note**: This is purely a learning exercise in the forbidden arts of Snowflake Streamlit development. No actual souls were harmed in the making of this application.
